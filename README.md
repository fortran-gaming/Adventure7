# Adventure 7

![Actions Status](https://github.com/fortran-gaming/Adventure7/workflows/ci_cmake/badge.svg)

Updated to actual Fortran 2008+ syntax, such as Gfortran 6 or Intel Fortran.

from <http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXpc.html>

This game is cross-platform thanks to Fortran.

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

Play from the Adventure7/build/ directory

```sh
./adventure
```

## Command line options

* `-c` cheat mode: (future) playback commands from plain-text file
* `-d` debug mode: prints debug info
* `-nosound` disables playback for systems without ffplay installed

## Game Versions

### Adventure 7 - GNU edition

Updated by Michael Hirsch, Ph.D. to true Fortran 2008 (where beneficial), removing proprietary Intel compiler, Quickwin and Windows-only library dependencies.
Attempt at cross-platform sound using shell call, will silently soft-fail.

### Adventure 7

maximum 560 points. re-written in standard Fortran 2008 from Adventure 6
with corrections and additions of sounds, color, basilisk, mermaid and
ruby yacht by Neal Van Eck, 2011. Intel Fortran Composer Quickwin
project using a few Quickwin routines for color and Windows-specific
APIs for sound.

### Adventure 6

based on Adventure 5 with additions by David Long, and an anonymous coder around 1984.
Doug McDonald changed it so that it would compile with f77 in 1990.

### Adventure 5

extended from the 350 point original to 501 points by David Long at the
University of Chicago around 1978.

## Test sound

Sound playback is via `ffplay`. Test by:

```sh
./testsound < testsound.txt
```

This was generated by:

```sh
ls -1 sounds | sed -e 's/.wav$//' > testsound.txt
```

---

This command is normally run automatically once at build time to setup the game data file.

```sh
./advgen
