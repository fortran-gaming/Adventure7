Adventure 7 maximum 560 points. re-written in standard Fortran 2008 from Adventure 6 with corrections and additions
of sounds, color, basilisk, mermaid and ruby yacht by Neal Van Eck, 2011.

Adventure 6 was based on Adventure 5 with additions by David Long, and an anonymous coder around 1984.
Doug McDonald changed it so that it would compile with f77 in 1990.

Adventure 5 was extended from the 350 point original to 501 points by David Long at the University of Chicago around 1978.

The program was compiled as an Intel Fortran Composer Quickwin project using a few Quickwin routines for color and standard APIs for sound.
